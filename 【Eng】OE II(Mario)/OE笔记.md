#### Dress & Fashion Design Pair Work Questions

##### 1) What is your feeling about the presence of 'knock-offs' in the fashion market?

*As we talked about last class, "knock-offs" means plagiarism. And plagiarism is illegal. Every designer should never copy others' drafts.* 

*The thing is, it is really hard to tell whether a work is copied or not. As I have taken design courses before, I know that to be a good designer, one should admire hundreds of thousands of others good designs.  And when you make your own design, some works you saw before would just come up in your mind even without conscience. That's why some designer didn't intend to copy, but after their works done, they may suddenly find that their works are so similar to some other famous designs.*

*And how can clothes producers avoid the loss by this kind of phenomena?* 

1. *to raise the product's quality. So that for the products of the same style, consumers would chose yours.*
2. *to make your design in a very specific style. Apple Material Design* 

##### 2) How do factors such as profession or technology affect a company's dress code?

*The reason why a company set a set of dress code is to* 

*safety*

*reliable*

*Brand color. associated with specific professions.*

*Different color could leave people different impressions, and this is true to both the employees and the customers if they can see the dress code.*

*example*

##### 3) Are you strongly influenced by climate when dressing like other people? How so? (dress like other people?

*Maybe not. I have a very strong personal style. I am a big fun of colorful dresses.*

##### 4) talk about any other English courses in the University. English teachers. What do we do. briefly.

*reading/listening/writing/translation courses.*

*In our reading course, our professor would let us perform some drama, or write our own poems with a given riddle in it, or paint pictures about texts. I think that's quite interesting.*
